# Product Planning Meeting
Date: 2025-01-15
Participants: Alice (Product Lead), Bob (Engineering Lead), Carol (Design Lead)

Alice: Good morning everyone. Let's start with the authentication discussion. We need to decide whether to require login for all features or allow anonymous access.

Bob: I've been thinking about this. From an engineering perspective, anonymous access is simpler to implement initially, but we lose valuable usage analytics.

Carol: From a UX standpoint, reducing friction is critical for adoption. Users hate creating accounts before they can see value.

Alice: I agree with Carol. Let's offer an anonymous tier for basic features. Users can upgrade to accounts when they want to save their work.

Bob: That works for me. We can still track anonymous sessions with cookies for basic analytics.

Carol: Perfect. So we're agreed - anonymous tier for frictionless adoption.

Alice: Yes, let's document that. Moving on - what's our target for community size before the next funding round?

Bob: I think 10,000 active users would be impressive to investors.

Alice: That might be too aggressive for our timeline. What about 5,000?

Carol: 5,000 seems achievable. Quality over quantity at this stage.

Bob: Alright, I can support 5,000. Let's target that.

Alice: Great, I love that target. 5,000 active users it is.

Alice: Last item - we need to discuss our spending approach. Should we go aggressive on growth or focus on sustainability?

Bob: I'm worried about our cloud costs. We're burning through the infrastructure budget faster than expected.

Carol: But if we don't grow fast, we'll miss the market window.

Alice: Let's park this for now. We need more data on unit economics before deciding.

Bob: Agreed. Let's revisit next week with actual cost projections.

Carol: Fine, but we can't keep delaying this decision.
